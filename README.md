PLAY UNO WITH FRIENDS UNDER YOUR OWN RULES!

Uno but better
------------------

- determine num of players
- each player gets 7-11 cards (# of players?)
- top card of deck gets revealed, or wild card
- draw 1 (default, stretch goal?)
- can play draw 2 on draw 2
- match colour or symbol
- reverse swaps player order
- skipturn is obv, skips a turn
- 2 players, reverse skips a turn
- draw 4s are wild
- draw 4 on plus 2, but not the other way around
- numbers 0-9, skip, rotate, draw 2, draw 4, wild, 1 zero, 2 of others
- player turn tracker
- randomize deck? could do it simply or more complicated
- force player to play playable cards? probably fine in our implementation, hands cannot be that big
- reshuffle diacard on empty draw pile
- can worry about exact randomness later
- sort player hands automatically
